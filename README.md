#PhoneBook

Imagine you have a phone book, but it's not a regular one. It's a special phone book where you can save contact information like names, organizations, and phone numbers.

Saving Contacts: You can add people's names, their organizations (like their workplace or school), and one or more phone numbers associated with them.
Finding Contacts: You can search for people's names or parts of their names (such as first name, middle name, last name) to find their contact information.
Removing Contacts : You can also delete someone's contact information if you don't need it anymore.
Implement a PhoneBook utilizing chaining scheme for hashing with collision handling using a chaining scheme. You can use the linked list implementation that you have developed in your second lab exercise.
